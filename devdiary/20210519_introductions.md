# Introductions, Wednesday 19th August 2021

Introductions, as if any were needed, are hard. I am tormented with an idea for a project which is burning a hole in my concentration so large you could drive a truck through it. The need to document my madness is strong. So, buckle up.

The first phase of this torment is trying to think of a way to describe the project to 'other people' in a way that always makes me hate the idea that I need to justify my time to other people. Also, because I am aware some of my ideas are, to be polite, a bit off the wall. Combined with a side of being terrified someone else has done a version of this that is better than the idea I have planned.

The first phase of hiding my embarrassment is to create a throw away GitHub account to hide my shame. And so here we are.

First off, the name for this project.

I was musing on the bio for this GitHub account, and I considered for a minute or two using the phase 'wannabe musician'. Of course, you should always describe yourself as what you want to be, musician, and inhabit the world in which you want to live regardless of skill level. But the word 'wannabe' of course has associations with a certain band. 

Next time: what is all this about?
